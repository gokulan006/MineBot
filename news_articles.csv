0,High prices stifle gold demand in top Asian hubs; India widens discount,2025-07-25,"Physical gold demand in key Asian hubs was subdued this week, asrising prices dampened sentiment, prompting dealers in top consumer China and India to offer steep discounts to attract buyers.Indian dealers offered discounts of up to $15 an ounce over official domestic prices this week, which include a 6% import and 3% sales tax, up from a discount of up to $10 last week.“Buyers are struggling to understand the broader trend. Prices were rallying at the beginning of the week but suddenly corrected mid-week,” said a Chennai-based jeweller.Domestic gold prices were trading around 98,500 rupees per 10 grams on Friday after rising to 100,555 rupees earlier this week.Jewellers were reluctant to purchase gold at current prices or even place orders for jewellery production, as retail demand has remained negligible for more than a month, said a Mumbai-based bullion dealer at a private bank.In China, dealers offered gold between a discount of $5 and a premium of $4 per ounce above international rates.“The physical demand is quite low because prices rose above $3,400. Price are too high, we are seeing some liquidation, selling interest. People are hesitant to buy at the moment,” said Peter Fung, head of dealing at Wing Fung Precious Metals.China’s imports of goldextended declines for a second successive month in June, customs data showed on Sunday.In Hong Kong, gold was sold at par to a premium of $1.50, while in Singapore gold traded between at-par prices and a $2.50 premium.“We’ve seen some clients who came to purchase, reason being they’re worried that the prices will continue to shoot further up. But I think more of a selling at this point of time,” said Brian Lan, managing director at Singapore-based GoldSilver Central.In Japan, bullion was sold at a discount of $0.50 to a $0.70 premium over spot prices.(By Brijesh Patel, Polina Devitt and Rajendra Jadhav; Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips)","Physical gold demand in key Asian hubs was subdued this week.

3,India plans to kickstart rare earth output to cut China reliance,2025-07-09,"A proposed plan by India to spur local production of rare earth magnets has drawn initial interest from a clutch of large conglomerates, people familiar with the matter said, as the country seeks to cut its reliance on China for these vital electric-vehicle and wind-turbine materials.The Indian government is planning an incentive program worth as much as 25 billion rupees ($290 million) for private sector firms manufacturing these magnets, said the people, who asked not to be named as the details are not public.Billionaire Anil Agarwal’s mining giant Vedanta Group, Sajjan Jindal-led JSW Group and EV parts maker Sona BLW Precision Forgings Ltd. are among those who have shown keenness in this initiative.The policy blueprint is likely to be submitted for cabinet approval soon, the people said. The final outlay for the program is subject to internal consultations and could change, they said.India is accelerating efforts on this front after China, which controls about 90% of the world’s rare earths processing, tightened export controls on rare earths amid a trade war with the US. This hasdisrupted supply chainsfor global automobile makers, including those operating in India.Infographic: Who controls rare earth processing?‘Don’t weaponize’Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi highlighted the need for a reliable supply of critical minerals at the BRICS gathering in Rio de Janeiro over the weekend. “It’s important to ensure that no country uses these resources for its own selfish gain or as a weapon against others,” Modi said at the event.The South Asian nation aims to support three to four large companies in the production of about 4,000 tons of neodymium and praseodymium-based magnets using locally-mined raw materials over a period of seven years, according to the people and a policy proposal seen byBloomberg News.There will be a two-year gestation period and incentives will be rolled out over five years following the start of manufacturing, the people said. India, with a rapidly growing electric vehicle sector, is considering an investment of up to 6 billion rupees for every 1,000 tons of capacity under the program, they added.“Our interest in rare earth magnet manufacturing stems from its strategic importance to green technologies,” a Vedanta spokesperson said in an email, adding that these minerals were “fast becoming new levers of global influence.”India, China tackle rare earth curbs in meeting of top officialsThe Ministry of Heavy Industries and JSW did not respond immediately to an email seeking comments.Producing magnets will help secure the supply chain for Sona BLW — one of the largest Indian makers of traction motors for electric vehicles, chief executive officer Vivek Vikram Singh toldBloomberg News. The company may seek a partner with a firm to develop technology for the magnets as well, Singh added.India is mulling incentives for rare earth magnet makers, Heavy Industries Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy said at an event in New Delhi last month, without elaborating.While the government’s effort to boost rare earths is in line with a worldwide push, its budget is modest and its timeframe remains ambitious. Mines and processing facilities can take years to build, and know-how stays heavily concentrated in China.Despite their name, rare earths are not geologically rare. But mining them economically is difficult, and often poses environmental risks due to their low concentrations and association with radioactive elements.Nascent effortsWhile India has long sought to boost production either domestically orthrough overseas projects, those efforts remain nascent. State-owned Khanij Bidesh India Ltd. is leading initial moves with mining concessions in Latin America and is talks with Argentina, Zambia and Australia among others.Currently, producing magnets in India without subsidies is nearly impossible. The necessary oxide is supplied by state-owned Indian Rare Earths Ltd., and a project’s return on investment in this sector is negative without both capital and operating subsidies, the people said.India taking steps to mitigate disruptions due to China’s rare earth curbsAccording to the proposed blueprint, the government will invite companies to bid for annual production capacity between 500 tons and 1,500 tons.To qualify, manufacturers must meet strict norms, including the requirement that half of the value of the final product must come from locally produced neodymium-praseodymium oxide, an ingredient crucial for making high-performance magnets, according to the proposal.The domestic sourcing requirement will rise to 80% by the fifth year of manufacturing, it added.(By Alisha Sachdev)","India is planning an incentive program worth as much as 25 billion rupees ($290 million) for private sector firms manufacturing these magnets.

4,"India to woo foreign copper miners, expand ties",2025-07-04,"India on Friday unveiled a series of steps to increase copper output, including encouraging foreign firms to set up smelters and refineries in the country in exchange for state-owned firms investing in their overseas mining operations.The government policy document, parts of which werefirst reported byReuterslast week, said India – the world’s second-biggest refined copper importer – may have to import 91%-97% of its copper concentrates by 2047.The country’s copper imports rose 4% to 1.2 million metric tons in fiscal 2025. Demand is expected to climb to 3-3.3 million metric tons by 2030 and 8.9-9.8 million metric tons by 2047, the document said.The document, which called for supply diversification and foreign asset acquisitions, also confirmed that India plans to promote investments by foreign companies, including Chile’s state-owned Codelco and Australian miner BHP, as part of its long-term focus by 2047.Reutershad first reported, quoting sources with knowledge of the matter and the document, that India could likely approach the two companies to set up domestic smelters, refineries and other downstream industries.Indian companies should also consider investing overseas to secure a steady supply chain and manage supply disruptions, the document added.India plans to provide financial support such as capital investment subsidies and customs duty exemption on imported plants and machineries for building 4-5 million metric tons of new smelting and refining capacity in the long-run, the document said. It may also consider providing financial support to scrap processing facilities.“Few viable options”Despite an estimated 12.2 million metric tons of copper resources, only 18% are classified as reserves, highlighting limited domestic availability, according to the document.Issues such as “resource nationalism, geopolitical tensions, declining ore grades,” and a persistent lack of investment globally could “leave India with few viable options to source copper, even from major exporters like Australia, Chile, Peru and Zambia.”India sends geologists to Zambia to explore copper and cobalt depositsIndia plans to include a chapter on copper in the ongoing free trade pact talks with Chile and Peru to secure a fixed quantity of copper concentrate, the document said.“Tightening copper supplies from key exporters like Indonesia and Panama have reduced India’s sourcing options,” the document said.Additionally, the Indian government released a document outlining plans to boost aluminum output and said domestic demand is expected at 8.5 million metric tons by fiscal 2030.(By Rishika Sadam and Neha Arora; Editing by Janane Venkatraman and Harikrishnan Nair)",India may have to import 91%-97% of its copper concentrates by 2047.

10,India’s new copper plant finally starts amid ore shortage,2025-06-18,"A new copper smelter owned by Indian billionaire Gautam Adani started processing mined ores this week after multiple delays due to a lack of feedstock, according to people familiar with the matter.The 500,000-ton-a-year Kutch Copper plant in Gujarat is part of a copper-producing complex that Adani is building to cut India’s reliance on imported metal. The smelter wasscheduled to start in 2024, but faced delays as smelter expansions elsewhere fueled a global shortage of ores.Raw materials are now being fed into the plant, but it could take 18 months for it to fully ramp up, said the people, who asked not to be identified due to the commercially sensitive nature of the matter. A typical ramp-up period is about two to three months.For the smelter to operate at full scale, it would require about 1.6 million tons of concentrated copper ores, some of the people said. Industry consultancy CRU Group has estimated that the gap between the volume of concentrates sought by smelters and those actually supplied by miners will reach 1.2 million tons this year, the biggest deficit in at least a decade.Kutch Copper has operationalized the smelter and is in the process of ramping up production to achieve peak capacity as soon as possible, a spokesperson for Adani Enterprises Ltd said in an emailed statement.Procuring concentrates has been a challenge for smelters globally, with growing competition from new plants fueling a collapse in processing margins.Codelco strikes copper deal with Adani amid tariff threatThe surge in capacity is being driven partly by the commissioning of new integrated plants at mining operations in Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. That’s reducing the flow of concentrates that would have otherwise been sold to other smelters.But the biggest contributor has been the breakneck growth of standalone smelters that buy most or all of their raw materials on the open market. That includes the new Adani plant, as well as several major operations in China, such as a new 500,000-ton-a-year copper smelter commissioned by Tongling Nonferrous Metals Group Co. earlier this year.(By Julian Luk and Archie Hunter)","A new copper smelter owned by Indian billionaire Gautam Adani started processing mined ores this week.

MdR responded by initiating legal and arbitration proceedings to regain the license.The concession was restored to MdR – owned by the estate of Ken Talbot, an Australian mining tycoon who died 14 years ago – last week, according to Mozambique’s database of natural resources permits. President Daniel Chapo’s cabinet had already reversed the cancellation of MdR’s mining contract with the government on April 15.“We are pleased with the outcome and express our gratitude to the government for its leading role in facilitating this,” a spokesperson for the Talbot estate said. “We are now focused on preparing the project for development and progressing the sale to JSW Steel.”A spokesperson for JSW – which is headed by the billionaire Sajjan Jindal – declined to comment.JSW extended its deadline for closing the deal by five months in late January, two weeks after Chapo replaced Nyusi as head of state in the southern African nation.The company is expanding its network of mining assets, both in India and overseas, to produce more of the iron ore and coking coal it requires to manufacture steel. The firm said in a February presentation that it was still working to acquire the pre-development stage project from MdR, which would give it access to as much as 280 million tons of premium coking coal.A spokesperson for Mozambique’s Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy didn’t answer a call, nor respond to questions about why the concession was returned to MdR.Last August, two months after the license was withdrawn from MdR, Nyusi’s government published a notice in a state-owned newspaper offering a 30-day window for any objections to the concession area being granted to a new company called Stonecoal SA. Four of Stonecoal’s five directors were employed at Jindal Steel & Power Ltd., another Indian steelmaker led by Naveen Jindal, Sajjan’s younger brother.One of Stonecoal’s directors toldBloombergin December that they intended to develop the project in their personal capacities.Naveen also chairs a private business called Vulcan International that owns Mozambique’s largest coal mine at Moatize, which lies adjacent to MdR’s license.Representatives of Stonecoal and JSPL didn’t respond to requests for comment.Both JSW and JSPL are part of the late OP Jindal’s Mumbai-based empire, which was divided among his four sons and is overseen by his widow Savitri, India’s richest woman.

18,ReElement Technologies accelerates rare earth production at Indiana plant,2025-04-22,"Amid escalating US-China trade tensions, American rare earth refiner ReElement Technologies says it will expand the operational equipment at its Noblesville plant in Indiana to meet surging demand for domestically sourced rare earth oxides.Earlier this month, the company — a subsidiary of American Resources Corporation (NASDAQ: AREC) — completed a round of capital fundraising to support the procurement and commissioning of new commercial-scale equipment for the Noblesville facility to expand its production capabilities, in light of China’s recent export restrictions on rare earth elements.China dominates the global rare earth sector, accounting for over 70% of mine production and nearly all of the world’s processing capacity. In response to the recent US tariffs, China began to weaponize this dominance by imposingexport restrictionson seven rare earth minerals.The US, meanwhile, has limited production and had been heavily reliant on China.Expansion projectsOn Monday, ReElement announced that it has completed the second phase of plant expansion to double its production of finished rare earth oxides, and is now undergoing a Phase 3 expansion that could triple the production over Phase 2. The company did not disclose the production capacity levels, only that the expansion is scheduled for May/June.The latest equipment expansion highlights the modular and scalable characteristics of ReElement’s refining technology, allowing for swift and flexible growth to meet the surging demand for ultra-pure, domestically produced rare earth oxides, the company stated in a news release.This added refining capacity will significantly increase the facility’s daily refining volumes of key rare earth elements, including neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium and terbium, ReElement said.ReElement’s modular, multi-feedstock refining platform — born from decades of research at Purdue University — is currently the only US-based scalable solution capable of economically separating and purifying rare earth elements.“By investing in and leveraging our innovative refining technology, our Noblesville facility is able to rapidly scale to meet the unprecedented customer demand we are seeing from our growing customer base,”  ReElement Technologies COO Jeff Peterson said in a news release.“Our Noblesville facility, located in an urban setting, demonstrates not only the scalability of our technology but also our commitment to environmentally responsible production of both heavy and light rare earth oxides,” CEO Mark Jensen said.While the Noblesville plant, covering a space of 700 square metres, represents ReElement’s flagship facility, the company has plans to build a larger centralized industrial space (over 50,000 sq. m) in Marion, Indiana, with a targeted initial capacity to produce 1,000 tonnes per year of ultra-pure (>99.5%) rare earth oxides. The Marion campus was once home to American technology giants such as Thompson Electronics, Farnsworth Radio and RCA.“While the [Noblesville] site was not originally intended to be commercial, growing customer demand, especially following recent global trade shifts, has made it an essential part of our operations as we continue developing our larger Marion facility,” Jensen added.","American rare earth refiner ReElement Technologies says it will expand the operational equipment at its Noblesville plant.

Trump has labelled India a high-tariff country and warned of “reciprocal tariffs” from early April.India’s trade minister Piyush Goyal is in the US for trade talks, aiming to negotiate potential tariff cuts as part of the proposed trade deal and to assess the impact of Trump’s planned reciprocal tariffs.India could, for instance, cut import duty on US steel scrap from 7.5% to nearly zero, and reduce tariffs on nuts, castings and forgings while offering concessions on selected agricultural and manufacturing items, Chadha said.Exporters also fear that India’s planned safeguard duty of up to 14% on steel imports, aimed at protecting local steel manufacturers from cheaper Chinese imports, will drive up domestic prices and squeeze their margins.India’s exports of engineering goods to the US jumped 18% year-on-year in January to $1.62 billion, outpacing the sector’s overall growth of 7.44% ahead of the tariffs, EEPC data showed.From April 2024 to January 2025, the first 10 months of the fiscal year, engineering exports to the US rose by an annual 9% to $15.6 billion, driven by an increase in shipments of aircraft parts, electrical machinery, automobiles, industrial machinery and medical instruments.“The engineering industry faces major challenges, and the latest US tariffs add pressure. Continued government support in export credit and technology is crucial for competitiveness,” Chadha said.India’s global engineering exports, which account for a quarter of total merchandise exports, rose to $9.42 billion in January from $8.77 billion a year earlier, though were lower than December’s $10.84 billion.

33,JSW Group to invest $301m in India copper mines in non-ferrous foray as steel prices dull,2025-01-27,"India’s steel-to-power conglomerate JSW Group will invest 26 billion rupees ($301.2 million) to set up operations at two copper mines, the company said on Monday, foraying into mining non-ferrous metals as steel prices fall.The billionaire Sajjan Jindal-led group has won two blocks of copper mines in the eastern mineral-rich state of Jharkhand from Hindustan Copper for a period of 20 years, with the option to extend it for another decade.“Venturing into non-ferrous metals, particularly copper, is a strategic move,” said Parth Jindal, the managing director of JSW Paints and the IPO-bound JSW Cement.Steel production in India has been hit by low prices, weak demand from top consumer China and cheap Chinese steel flooding domestic markets — the effect of which has led to the group’s flagship firm JSW Steel missing profit estimates for the past four quarters in a row.With the expansion, JSW Steel will directly compete with Vedanta, Hindalco, Hindustan Copper and Adani Copper – all of which currently dig up the brown metal used to make cables and wires.Once ramped up, the mines will have a copper ore capacity of 3 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) and are expected to be part-operational in the second half of the fiscal year 2027, the group said in a statement.($1 = 86.3290 Indian rupees)(By Hritam Mukherjee; Editing by Mrigank Dhaniwala and Savio D’Souza)",India’s steel-to-power conglomerate JSW Group will invest 26 billion rupees ($301.2 million) to set up operations at two copper mines.

34,China extends coal imports lead over India to widest in more than a decade,2025-01-16,"China, the world’s biggest coal consumer, extended its lead in imports over No. 2 buyer India last year to the widest since at least 2013, customs data shows, cementing its hold on global coal markets and helping to curb a slide in prices.Global thermal coal prices haveretreated from record highshit after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, but are 50% higher than the average during the 2017-19 period, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).“China’s appetite is causing prices to remain in the current range. If not, prices will really go down,” Ramli Ahmad, president director at Indonesian miner Ombilin Energi, toldReuters.Chinese coal imports hit a record 542.7 million metric tons in 2024, customs data showed, more than double the 250.2 million tons imported by India, expanding what had been a narrowing gap in the four years before the pandemic, when China’s lead averaged 26%, customs and shipping data showed.Purchases by China this year translated to a record 41% of global imports, said Toby Hassall, research lead for coal markets at LSEG.While the IEA and information provider Argus expect Chinese coal imports to shrink in the near future, the IEA warned that “Chinese imports have repeatedly come in higher than expected in recent years”.Argus said it expects relaxations in stock building requirements for Chinese power plants and coal’s decreasing share in power generation to reduce imports of the polluting fuel in 2025, but said volumes would still be close to 2024 levels due to steady demand from industries.China versus IndiaChinese buyers showed increased preference for foreign coal last year due to discounts to domestic prices, while India’s coal production is more competitively priced due to low production costs, industry players said.Both China and India have sought to boost production in order to lower import bills, but frequent mine inspections in China haveslowed output growthin the country.Indian imports of thermal coal – a power generation fuel – fell about 3% last year, while in China they rose 13% in the first 11 months of 2024.Coking coal imports by India grew by 4.7% in 2024, according to consultancy Bigmint, while Chinese imports of the fuel used in steelmaking rose 23% in the 11 months ended November, customs data showed, partly due to disruptions from mine accidents in the key producing hub of Shanxi.Indian buyers gravitated towards cheaper Indonesian and South African thermal coal at the expense of Russian and Australian cargoes, Bigmint data showed.“As Russian coal became less price-competitive, countries like Indonesia and South Africa have regained their positions as major suppliers to India,” said Vasudev Pamnani, director at India’s I-Energy Natural Resources.China boosted procurement of thermal coal from neighbouring Russia and Mongolia in 2024, cutting dependence ontop exporter Indonesia.“Any reduction in Chinese demand will likely impact smaller Indonesian suppliers first, before rolling onto other marginal suppliers such as Colombia or South Africa,” Argus said in its annual report.(By Sudarshan Varadhan and Colleen Howe; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise)Read More:Coal demand to keep hitting records through 2027, IEA says",China extended its lead in imports over No. 2 buyer India last year to the widest since at least 2013.

36,Indian steel titan’s coal deal frozen amid Mozambique legal row,2025-01-08,"India’s largest steelmaker has been sidelined by a legal dispute that’s derailed its deal to buy a coal concession in Mozambique.JSW Steel Ltd. — run by Sajjan Jindal — agreed in May to buy Minas de Revuboè from the estate of Ken Talbot, an Australian mining tycoon who died 14 years ago. Before the deal could be completed, the Mozambican government revoked MdR’s lease to mine coal valued at about $50 billion.In August, two months after the license was withdrawn from MdR, the Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy published a notice in Mozambique’s state-owned newspaper offering a 30-day window for any objections to the concession being awarded to Stonecoal SA. Four of Stonecoal’s five directors are employed at Jindal Steel & Power Ltd., a company headed by Naveen Jindal, Sajjan’s younger brother.The loss of the rights has triggered a legal battle between MdR and Mozambique’s government, leaving JSW as an observer. It comes at a critical time for the country, after disputed elections last October triggered demonstrations in which at least 278 people have died. That will test Daniel Chapo — due to be inaugurated as president on Jan. 15 — who has prioritized stability for international investors.Both JSW Steel and JSPL are part of the late OP Jindal’s $35 billion Mumbai-based empire, which was divided among his four sons and is overseen by his widow Savitri, India’s richest woman. The brothers occasionally have small cross-holdings in each others’ companies, but they are run separately and even occasionally compete against each other.Sajjan’s JSW first agreed to acquire MdR in November 2023, according to a spokesperson for the Talbot estate, and in May announced a final deal under which it agreed to pay $74 million for a 92% stake. That’s a fraction of the $555 million that 12 years earlier Anglo American Plc said it would pay for a 58.9% stake in the same coal project. The London-based mining giant walked away from the transaction eight months later.Naveen chairs a private business called Vulcan International that owns Mozambique’s largest coal mine at Moatize, which lies adjacent to the concession stripped from MdR. The younger Jindal brother — now a lawmaker with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party — acquired the asset three years ago in a $270 million deal with Brazil’s Vale SA.JSPL also owns a smaller coal mine in Mozambique called Chirodzi.Stonecoal applicationStonecoal, which applied for the coal-mining rights in August, isn’t part of JSPL or Vulcan and has nothing to do with Naveen Jindal, according to director Parshant Goyal. Goyal said that he and three other Stonecoal directors employed at Naveen’s JSPL are pursuing the development in a “personal capacity,” only becoming aware that MdR was at risk of losing the concession after the termination took place.The concession has yet to be granted to Stonecoal, according to Mozambique’s database of mining licenses.Stonecoal is registered at the same residential address — in an upmarket neighborhood of Maputo — as RockWorld, a group of companies chaired by the eldest son of Mozambique’s outgoing president, Filipe Jacinto Nyusi. Nyusi’s son isn’t a Stonecoal director, according to a company certificate produced by the government.Goyal, who is the chief executive officer of JSPL’s African operations, declined to answer questions about the identity of Stonecoal’s shareholders. The company’s owners are not disclosed in the certificate seen byBloomberg.Stonecoal was set up on Feb. 5, according to Mozambique’s official gazette. That was the day before MdR received an initial revocation notice from the Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy, a document seen byBloombergshows. While the ministry reversed that decision following a challenge by MdR, it ordered the cancellation of the concession again on June 13.Mozambique’s Council of Ministers, headed by Nyusi, approved the removal of MdR’s mining contract on July 9, according to a resolution published the following month in the gazette.The ministry and the office of the presidency didn’t respond to emails and phone calls seeking comment.JSW declined to comment, while JSPL and Vulcan didn’t respond to emails fromBloomberg. Nor did RockWorld.Geneva arbitrationMdR filed a court case in Mozambique seeking to compel the government to restore the lost lease. In September, the company also initiated arbitration proceedings in Geneva against both the Mineral Resources Ministry and the presidency. Stonecoal isn’t part of the legal actions.Mozambique and MdR exchanged several responses last month in the arbitration, which is being overseen by the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes. The first meeting of the tribunal is expected during the first quarter of this year, according to the spokesperson for Talbot’s estate.“MdR’s focus is on having the original concession reinstated such that it can complete the sale of the project to JSW,” the spokesperson said in an email. “We consider the termination of the contract is illegal and does not follow due process.”Including the acquisition of the asset, MdR spent $300 million on the project, according to the Talbot estate spokesperson. The company disputes the ministry’s claim — included in the first revocation notice — that a lack of exploration works justified the permit’s cancellation.There were, however, land disputes — including with a local mayor — that resulted in a force majeure situation that obstructed progress at the concession, the Talbot estate spokesperson said. While those circumstances were previously acknowledged and accepted by the ministry, they were later “completely disregarded” by the Mozambican government, the spokesperson said.Syrah Resources declares force majeure for graphite mine in MozambiqueThe legal spat comes at a difficult time for the incoming Mozambique government, as the civil unrest also takes its toll on mining operations. Last month, Melbourne-headquartered Syrah Resources Ltd. declared force majeure for its Balama graphite project, while Perth-based South32 Ltd. withdrew guidance for its aluminum smelter in the country, saying the transport of raw materials had been interrupted.Mozambique is also waiting for TotalEnergies SE and Exxon Mobil Corp. to decide on whether to revive the development of huge liquefied natural gas projects that have the potential to transform one of Africa’s poorest countries. The French company is leading a $20 billion LNG export project in the northeastern Cabo Delgado province that’s been on hold since 2021 because of nearby attacks by an Islamic State-backed insurgency.Further afield, the thwarted transaction with MdR is a blow to JSW’s plans to mine more of the key materials required for making steel. The groups run by Sajjan and Naveen are among India’s biggest steelmakers, and both need to source large volumes of coking coal and iron ore for their operations.JSW Steel said in an August presentation that the concession has the potential to produce 280 million tons of premium hard-coking coal.(By William Clowes and Matthew Hill)","JSW Steel Ltd. agreed in May to buy Minas de Revuboè from the estate of Ken Talbot, an Australian mining tycoon who died 14 years ago.
